# More on Assembly.

We would like to go more in depth on assembly language, as it will be essential to understanding computer architecture and how programs are executed in a particular architecture. As we have mentioned before, different architectures produce different assembly for the same source code. Assembly of one program compiled on an `x86` machine will have assembly different to that of the same program compiled on an `ARM` processor. Actually, assembly produced under different flavors of `x86` will also be different. We focus on the `x86` architecture and the assembly for it.

## Registers.

We went over one type of register previously, and that is the `rip`/`eip` register. We call it the _instruction pointer_ because it points to the next instruction in memory. This is what the program counter uses to keep track of instructions. In `x86_64` machines, the instruction pointer is denoted by `rip`, in assembly where as for `x86_32` machines, it is denoted as `eip` in assembly. Modern computers now usually use `64` bit addressing, so we will refer to this register as `rip`. `rip` is very important in assembly because it will tell the machine which instruction to execute next. When we call a register a _pointer_ that means the register stores a memory address, in the case of the instruction pointer, it contains the address of the next instruction in memory. There are other pointers such as the stack pointer which contains an address at the top of a stack \(more on these registers below\).

Typically, when a pointer contains an address, we say that the pointer _points_ to the address. It is no surprise that there is a `1-1` correspondence between pointers in assembly and pointers in `C/C++`.

The instruction pointer isn't the only register that assembly uses. `x86` typically has several registers, and they act as internal variables for the processor \(we make the distinction now, in order to avoid it later; registers in `x86_64` are preappended by an `r`, such as that in `rip`, while `x86_32` are preappended by an `e`, like in `eip`. Since we will be considering largely `x86_64` we will for the most part consider registers preappened by `r`\). Consider the following `helloWorld.c` program:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){

    printf("Hello, world!\n");

    return 0;
}
```

compile it with `gcc -g -o hello helloWorld.c` and consider the following list of registers extracted from the `hello` binary with the `gdb` debugger \(which will be discussed next section\):

```c

The first `4` registers are the _general purpose registers_. They are called \(in order of appearance\) the _accumulator_, _base_, _counter_, and _data_ registers, and are denoted as `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, and `rdx` respectively. These registers are the main registers that will be used as temporary variables for the CPU, they can also be used for other purposes. The second `4` registers are the _source index_, _destination index_, _base pointer_, and _stack pointer_ registers and are `rsi`, `rdi`, `rbp`, and `rsp` respectively. These are also general purpose registers and are used for indexing data and pointing to addresses in memory. For example `rbp` and `rsp` are used for setting up a stack. So these registers are important for memory management within the program. There are load and store instructions that use these registers, but they can mainly be used as general purpose registers. The remaining registers `r9-r15` can also be considered general purpose, though they are not as important as the first `8` registers. Next comes the instruction pointer `rip`. Next we have the `eflag` registers, which just serve to make comparisons and to keep track of segmented memory. These can be ignored as they rarely need to be accessed directly.

## Assembly Syntax.

Assembly syntax varies, however there are two syntaxes that we will consider. The first is the `AT&T` syntax and the second is the `intel` syntax. Both have their differences. Typically, `intel` syntax looks like:

```text
operation   <destination>   <source>
```

whereas `AT&T` syntax looks like:

```text
operation   %<source>       %<desitination>
```

Here the % in `AT&T` assembly syntax is used to denote registers. It is also the syntax that is used by most compilers, hence we will consider it more than the `intel` syntax. The following is a disassembly of the `main()` procedure in the `helloWorld.c` program above:

```c
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000001139 <+0>:    push   %rbp
   0x000000000000113a <+1>:    mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x000000000000113d <+4>:    lea    0xec0(%rip),%rax        # 0x2004
   0x0000000000001144 <+11>:    mov    %rax,%rdi
   0x0000000000001147 <+14>:    call   0x1030 <puts@plt>
   0x000000000000114c <+19>:    mov    $0x0,%eax
   0x0000000000001151 <+24>:    pop    %rbp
   0x0000000000001152 <+25>:    ret
```

Operations in assembly can be _unaray_, taking one argument, such as the above instruction `push %rbp`, or they could be _binary_ taking two arguments, such as `mov %rsp, %rbp`. Operations in assembly are usually intuitive mnemonics, for example `mov` moves the data from one register into the other \(overwriting the previous data in the process\), and `push` pushes the value of a register onto a stack. Operations beginning with a `j` usually denote a _jump_ from one instruction to another; for example `jle` stands for "jump if less than or equal", and jumps to a location in memory if the current value is less than or equal to the one it is being compared too. `jle` is usually preceded by a `cmp` instruction which compares the relevant values.

What is important to keep kin mind is that the first few instructions form what is called the _function prologue_ \(or _procedure prologue_\) and are called to set up the memory for what comes after. The last few instructions likewise are called the _function epilogue_ \(_procedure epilogue_\) and returns the memory to the state it was before the function prologue was called. In the above disassembly:

```c
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000001139 <+0>:    push   %rbp
   0x000000000000113a <+1>:    mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x000000000000113d <+4>:    lea    0xec0(%rip),%rax        # 0x2004
```

sets up the memory to call the `main()` function while

```c
   0x0000000000001151 <+24>:    pop    %rbp
   0x0000000000001152 <+25>:    ret
```

returns the memory to how it was before the prologue was called. Notice how the function epilogue effectively inverses the function prologue.

## Words, DWORDS, and QWORDS .

Integer data types, like in `C` are stored in `4` bytes in assembly. In this instance, we say that the `int` data type is one "word" in memory. The basic unit of data is a `byte`, and assembly organizes these data units in `4` byte units called _words_. We call a _halfowrd_ something that is `2` bytes in size, hence the name, and data presented in `8` bytes is called a _giant_, so `double`s in `C` are stored in giants in assembly code.

There are other conventions for words. Most notably `dwords` and `qword`. Like the mnemonic suggests, a `dword` is a _double word_, that is, it is a unit of two words. A `qword` is mnemonic for _quad word_ and encompasses a unit of four words. In some cases this terminology can be confusing. In some circles, a `dword` is referred to as `4` bytes \(i.e. the same as a word.\), and a word as `2` bytes \(i.e the same as a half word\); that is the terms `word` and `dword` can be used interchangeably. If this is the case, then `qword` can also be meant to be four `words` in length or two `words`. In this case it is usually useful to know which context these terminologies are being used and what is meant by a `word`. Just knowing the size of a `word` in context is enough to know which conventions you are working with because `dword` and `qword` will always stand for double and quad words, respectively.

## Memory Segmentation.

Before we can even consider doing anything with assembly, or even analyzing it, we must know how memory is managed by programs. We exclusively consider `C` programs compiled with the `gcc` compiler.

A compiled programs memory is allocated into five _segments_ \(blocks of contiguous memory\) called the _text_ segment \(or _code_ segment\), _data_ segment, _bss_ segment, the _heap_, and the _stack_.

### The Text Segment.

The text segment is where the program's assembled machine language instructions are located; and due to the high level control structures of `C`, execution in this segment of memory is nonlinear. When a program executes, `rip` is set to the first instruction in the text segment, and the processor does the following:

1. Read the instruction pointed to by `rip`.
2. Add the byte length of the instruction to `rip`.
3. Execute the instruction.
4. Repeat step 1.

If the processor encounters a jump instruction, it will change the value of `rip` to the address specified by the `jmp` and repeat step 1. The text segment only needs to be read, hence write permissions are disabled for this segment. It prevents attempts from modifying the code to d anything it shouldn't and will alert the user and kill the process if a write is attempted. It makes sense as why should one be able to write already compiled code. This security measure also prevents malicious actors from being able to modify the code directly once it has been compiled. However, hackers have other ways of modifying program execution.

### The Data and BSS Segments.

The data and bss segments store static and global variables \( a static variable in `C` is any variable declared `static <type>`\). If the variable is initialized with a value, it is stored in the data segment, and if it is not it is stored in the bss segment. Since static and global variables are stored in their own segments, they are able to persist throughout runtime.

### The Heap.

The heap is the segment in memory that a programmer can directly control. Memory in this segment is allocated on a "as need" basis, and freed accordingly; with this the programmer can allocate and free memory for whatever they might need the program to do.

Since the heap allocates memory on the fly for the programmer, it is not of a fixed size, and can grow \(when allocating memory\) or shrink \(when freeing memory\) ass needed. Typically the heap starts at the lower memory addresses and grows towards higher memory addresses.

### The Stack

On the opposite side of the heap \(literally\), the stack is a another variable size memory segment, and grows from the higher memory segments towards lower memory addresses \(in most implementations\). The stack is used mainly as a place to store addresses to functions \(for function calls\), and non global/static variables. When these functions or variables are no longer needed, they are popped off of the stack. This is the reason why variables declared in functions "die" when the function terminates; where as global/static variables persist.

When a function is called with the `call` instruction in assembly, the address of `rip` is changed to that of the function, and the program continues in the function's block of memory. If `rip` is not changed when the relevant function finishes, the program would terminate \(or crash\), for this reason, the stack stores a copy of the address `rip` should return to after the function terminates, so that execution can can be proceed as it should. We call the address the stack saves the _saved `rip`_ address. The stack also "remembers" all the passed variables \(function arguments\). All this information, the address of the function, the saved frame pointer, the variables of the function, and the function's arguments are all stored together on a _stack frame_. The stack can have multiple stack frames coinciding with multiple function calls. The stack is literally a stack data structure, and hence follows the _FILO_ \(_first in last out_\) ordering. As functions are called, stack frames are _pushed_ onto the stack, and once the functions terminate, they are _popped_ off.

The stack pointer `rsp` is used to keep track of what is at the top of the stack, and changes location as stack frames are pushed onto and popped off the stack, hence the name "stack pointer".

When a function is called, several things are pushed onto the stack in a stack frame. The aforementioned function address, variables, arguments, are bundled together as discussed above; in addition, `rbp` is also in the stack frame, and in this context is called the _frame pointer_. `rbp` points to locations within the stack frame itself, and is used to reference local function variables. Another pointer called the _saved frame pointer_ is also stored in the stack frame, as well as the _return_ address of the function. The saved frame pointer and the saved `rip` are necessary to return the execution flow to where it should be once the stack frame is popped. The saved frame pointer returns `rbp` to its previous address before the function call, and the saved `rip` returns `rip` to the address after call. The saved `rip` is also called the _return_ address of the function. The instruction in assembly to restore `rip` is `ret`. The first few instructions in the function prologue effectively set up the stack frame for the function. The function epilogue are the instructions that restore everything.

### Heap vs. Stack.

The heap and the stack are found as far apart from each other as possible, and grow towards each other. This is to maximize the amount of space each memory segment can access. As the heap grows, the stack has less memory to use, and vice versa as the stack grows. It is for this reason why we want the heap and the stack to be as far from each other as possible. If they were to collide, the program wouldn't be able to tell which address was allocated on the heap, and which belongs to the stack. This, unsurprisingly would cause the program to behave disastrously.

## Assembly vs `C`.

`C` is a relatively low level language when compared to other high level programming languages, and indeed `C` was in part developed to be as similar to assembly as possible. However programming in `C` is different from programming to assembly. Thankfully, the similarities mean that the underlying principles do not change much.

Consider the `helloWorld.c` program from before:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){

    printf("Hello, world!\n");

    return 0;
}
```

The preprocessor directive is declared including the `stdio.h` header file, then `main()` is declared, and then `printf()`, which relies on `stdio.h` is called with the string `Hello, world!\n` as an argument. We then terminate the function `main()` with a `return`, specifying to return `0` to signify success. The principle will be similar to when we want to program in assembly. We would like to specify a header file for which we will use a procedure which we will use to print our string. We will set up a `main()` function to call it, and we would want to add a return that also signifies that the program exited successfully. Let us go more in depth

In `C`, standard libraries are called for convenience and portability. Using `printf()` in our program will enable our program to be compiled for different architectures and systems. We can do that is because the standard libraries know the system calls to be able to output the string `Hello, world!` to the screen.

Now when `helloWorld.c` is compiled and the binary is run, the execution will flow through the `stdio` library, and makes a syscall to `write`. Which writes `Hello, world!` to the output in the screen. We can view how syscalls work with `man 2 syscall` and we can look at individual syscalls with `man 2 <syscall>` where `<syscall>` is the syscall you want to view.

We can view the syscalls that the program makes using the `strace` command, which traces the syscalls that a program makes. In this example, we get that our `helloWorld` program makes the following syscalls

```bash
~/ccom4086/ > gcc -o hello helloWorld.c
~/ccom4086/ > ./hello
Hello, world!
~/ccom4086/ > strace ./hello

)         = 14
exit_group(0)                           = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
```

Here we see that the `hello` program sets up the environments memory for execution, making various syscalls. However, the most important syscalls are the `write()` and `exit()` syscalls:

```bash
write(1, "Hello, world!\n", 14Hello, world!
)         = 14
exit_group(0)                           = ?
```

Here we see that `write()` is called with three arguments. The first is the _file descriptor_ for `stdout`. File descriptors are used for everything in `unix`; input, output, networking, etc. What a file descriptor is is a reference to a file, which is referenced by an integer. In this case, the file descriptor is `1` for `stdout`. The first three file descriptors `0`, `1`, and `2` are used for input \(`0`\), output \(`1`\), and errors \(`2`\). What the `write()` syscall does with the file descriptor is specify where to write it's argument; in this case it will write the argument to `stdout`, which means to print on the screen.

The second argument for the `write()` syscall is the message we actually want to write out; in this case "Hello, world!" with a newline character, and the third argument is the length of the message. `Hello, world!\n` has a length of `14` bytes.

Next comes the `exit()` syscall, which just takes one argument: the _exit code_. `exit()` is called with exit code `0` which means that the program terminated successfully. Calling `exit()` with exit code `1` indicates that the program exited with error\(s\).

In assembly, every linux syscall is enumerated, and hence referenced by numbers when making calls in assembly. For example the syscall number for `write()` is `1` in `x86_64` and `4` in `x86_32`; so the syscall numbers are dependent of architecture. For additional reference, exit has syscall numbers `60` and `1` in `x86_64` and `x86_32` respectively. We can view syscall numbers in unix by running `cat` on the appropriate file in the `/usr/include/asm/` directory.

We are now in a position to write our `helloWorld` program in assembly language. We now know the relevant syscalls to `write()` and `exit()`, as well as what we want to print out to the screen `Hello, world!\n` \(recall that `stdout` takes in to account newline characters\). We will use slightly different syntax from the assembly we've seen so far, as the assembler we will be using it requires it. We will be using `nasm` as the assembler, which takes `intel` syntax.

Recall how memory is segmented in a program. We want to specify the `data` segment, so that we can store the string `Hello, world!\n` and we want to specify the `text` segment which will contain our assembly code. So far, then our assembly will have a data segment that looks like:

```c
section .data
   msg:     db      "Hello, world!", 10
```

Here `msg` is the variable we will be using to store our string. It takes `Hello, world!`, and then `10` which will specify the new line character.

Now we want to set up our `text` segment. Recall that in order to write the code, we have to set up the memory on that stack. We must declare a "main" procedure; in the case of `nasm` this procedure is named `_start`. So we have:

```c
section .text
    global _start
```

Then we call `_start` which pushes the stack frame onto the stack. Now we want to set up the memory to be able to call our syscalls. That is we need to set up the syscall, the arguments that it takes, and then call it. In the case of `write()`, it takes `3` arguments, so we have to set up `3` registers. In `man 2 syscall`, the calling convention specifies that `rax` is the register we use to set up the syscall. `rdi`, `rsi`, and `rdx` are the registers used for the first, second, and third arguments of a syscall, respectively. Finally we call `write()` in `x86_64` assembly by calling the `syscall` instruction. \(In `x86_32`, we would call `int 0x80`\). So we have our text section looking like:

```c
_start:
    mov     rax,    1
    mov     rdi,    1
    mov     rsi,    msg
    mov     rdx,    14
    syscall
```

Similarly, to set up `exit()`, we have:

```c
    mov     rax,    60
    mov     rdi,    0
    syscall
```

Now we are done with the code, so the final product is the following assembly program:

```c
; helloWorld.asm
; A helloWorld program in 64 bit assembly.

section .data
    msg:    db      "Hello , world!", 10

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov     rax,    1   ;  set up SYS_write().
    mov     rdi,    1   ; wrtie to stdout in write arg 1.
    mov     rsi,    msg ; write our sting in write arg 2.
    mov     rdx,    14  ; write string length in write arg 3.
    syscall             ; call SYS_write().

    mov     rax,    60  ; setup SYS_exit().
    mov     rdi,    0   ; Exit status 0 for success.
    syscall             ; call SYS_exit()
```

We should specify that everything that comes after `;` is interpreted as a comment by `nasm`. Now we wish to compile this code into a program. We do this with `nasm`, using the `-f` flag to specify the architecture, `-o` to specify the output file, and our assembly program.

```bash
~/ccom4086/ > nasm -f elf64 -o hello.o helloWorld.asm
```

This produces the `hello.o` object file, which we cannot run, so we need the use of a linker to be able to output a proper binary. Luckily, `linux` comes with a linker called the _GNU linker_, and is called via the `ld` command in the terminal. Thus we input `hello.o` into the `ld` to get a `hello` binary. Running `hello` should output `Hello, world!` on the screen.

```bash
~/ccom4086/ > ld -o hello hello.o
~/ccom4086/ > ./hello
Hello, world!
```

We have just created and run our first assembly program.

### `32` Bit Considerations.

The assembly program we just created was created for `64` bit architectures; specifically, for `x86_64`. If one wanted to create `helloWorld.asm` for `32`, one would have to rewrite the program to accommodate `32` bit registers and calling convention. For example we can no longer use `rdi`, `rsi`, and `rdx` to set up the arguments for `write()`. Instead `32` bit calling convention reserves `ebx`, `ecx` and `edx` for the first three arguments of any given syscalls. Similarly, syscalls cannot be called with `syscall`, but are instead called with the `int` instruction, which stands for _interrupt_, `int` sends an interrupt to the operating systems kernel to execute a process. In this case, `int 0x80` is the interrupt for calling syscalls. Rewriting `helloWorld.asm`, the program would look like:

```c
; helloWorld32.asm
; A helloWorld program written in 32 bit assembly.

section .data
    msg:    db      "Hello, world!", 0xa

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov     eax,    0x4     ; Set up SYS_write().
    mov     ebx,    0x1     ; Write to stdout in write arg 1.
    mov     ecx,    msg     ; Put the string in write arg 2.
    mov     edx,    0x14    ; Put string length in write arg 3.
    int     0x80            ; call SYS_write().

    mov     eax,    0x1     ; Set up SYS_exit().
    mov     ebx,    0x0     ; Exit code 0, success.
    int     0x80            ; Cal SYS_exit().
```

Similarly, to get `nasm` to compile for `32` bit, it has to be run with the `elf_32` flag. To get `ld` to link it, we must also specify `32` bit architecture with the `-m` flag.

```bash
~/ccom4086/ > nasm -f elf32 -o hello.o helloWorld32.asm
~/ccom4086/ > ld -m elf_i386 -o hello hello.o
~/ccom4086/ > ./hello
Hello, world!
```

## Other Assembly Language Considerations.

Assembly language isn't just a language to program for fun. It is a direct analogue to machine language. That means that assembly is intrinsically tied to the hardware of any given machine. Desktop, laptop, and server computers all have their own assembly language; as do microcontrollers, and even GPUs.

Since assembly is 1-1 with machine code, we do not have to program in machine code to be able to see how the hardware works. Instead of remembering binary representations for instructions such a `add` and `mov`, we can remember the mnemonics. Instead of having to worry about specific addresses, we can just name variables and registers. We can also even enter into coding machine code and back.

Assembly language also allows for very granular control. The downside is that it makes it hard to debug and maintain, however programming in assembly should be done sparingly. It also helps hackers compromise systems. By understanding the assembly, they can get the system they want to compromise to do whatever they want. The can also write pieces of assembly code called _shellcode_ that when injected into a vulnerable program, allows them arbitrary code execution.

Assembly language teaches us how the hardware works, so understanding the assembly lets us understand the hardware. It also introduces a programming paradigm that focuses on relying on very low level solutions, which introduce problem solving techniques. One example of this is how we can optimize a program by working with its assembly counterpart. It can also do things better than certain other high level languages, such as self modifying code, writing drivers, and kernel components for an operating systems, writing drivers, and kernel components for an operating system. It even helps with better interacting with higher level languages and write in them more efficiently.
