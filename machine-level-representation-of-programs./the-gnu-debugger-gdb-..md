# The GNU Debugger \(gdb\).

A **debugger** is a piece of software that is used to debug programs and To **debug** is to find logical and semantic errors in one's code andremove them. We can go even a step further and degub the binary. To be clear, the word _program_ and _binary_ are analogous to eachother, hwoever when used coloquially, the word program also specifies the **source code**, which is what the programmer writes. We then use program to mean either and leave the context to distinguish between the two uses.

The difference between debugging source code and debugging a program is that one entails removing errors found in the source itself, and the other entails disassembling the program to find **runtime** errors and fix them, and to optimize and observe the code. For example, a debugger can be used to find out what is happening when a program encounters a **segmentation violation**, which is an error that occurs when the program tries to access an illegal address in memory. Another example is a hacker trying to overflow a buffer and insert shellcode; they then open a debugger to view the addresses that they need to execute the buffer overflow attack.

The principle debugger that is used, for this class, and in general in the field is the **GNU debugger**, more coloquially known as **`gdb`**. Below is typically what a `gdb` instance looks like when run through the terminal. Here we use `gdb` on the `sum` program.

```bash
~/ccom4086/ > gcc -Og -g -o sum sum.c

Here we compile `sum.c` with the debug flag `-g` which includes extra debugging information that we can use in `gdb`. It is not nessesary however. Notice that:

```text
~/ccom4086/ > gcc -Og -o sum sum.c
~/ccom4086/ > gdb -q sum
Reading symbols from sum...
(No debugging symbols found in sum)
(gdb) list
No symbol table is loaded.  Use the "file" command.
(gdb) disassemble sumstore
Dump of assembler code for function sumstore:
   0x000000000000111e <+0>:    push   %rbx
   0x000000000000111f <+1>:    mov    %rdx,%rbx
   0x0000000000001122 <+4>:    call   0x1119 <plus>
   0x0000000000001127 <+9>:    mov    %rax,(%rbx)
   0x000000000000112a <+12>:    pop    %rbx
   0x000000000000112b <+13>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
(gdb) quit
```

Notice how we can not get a view of the source code without the `-g` flag. Here the `-q` flag just suppresses the copyright information displayed upon running `gdb`. We will be running `gdb` with this flag to make examples consise.
