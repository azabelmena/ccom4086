The microprocessor is among the most complex systems ever created. A single
silicon schip on the scale of nanometers contains several high performance
processors, memory caches, and the logic required to interface to external
devices. The processors today implemented on a single chip vastly outcompete
the room-size supercomputers that were used just decades ago. The
microprocssors found in the smart phones in 2021, already dwarf the ones used
in the Apollo moon missions.
